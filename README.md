# Fish Weight Prediction

## Project Overview
The **Fish Weight Prediction** project uses machine learning to predict the weight of fish based on various features, such as species, length, height, and width. The model provides accurate weight predictions and offers an interactive interface for user input.

## Features
- Predicts fish weight from features like length, height, and width.
- Supports multiple fish species.
- Interactive user interface for easy input and prediction.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarmanpreetKaur21/Fish_Weight_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Fish_Weight_Prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script to train the model and predict fish weights:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Input the features (length, height, width, species) to get the predicted fish weight.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing various fish species and their characteristics. It includes features like length, height, and width, along with the corresponding fish weight.
